# DSA-Python-Code-Catalog 
Code Catalog of Data Structures and Algorithms for coding interview prep

This is for my practice with Data Structures and Algorithms and getting comfortable using Git and GitHub

Repository includes implementation of key Data Structures, examples, as well as a section within each chapter of respective leetcode questions that pertain to the DS being covered

I utilized the following book to review DSA topics and examples in Python:
