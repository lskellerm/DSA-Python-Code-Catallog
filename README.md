# DSA-Python-Code-Catalog 
Code Catalog of Data Structures and Algorithms for coding interview prep

This is for my practice with **_Data Structures and Algorithms_**, getting comfortable using _**Git and GitHub**_, and _**creating
unit tests**_ to ensure valid behavior of implemented Data Structures

Repository includes implementation of key Data Structure, algorithms, as well as their respective _**unit tests**_, using
Python's _unittest_ module 

I utilized the following book to review DSA topics and examples in Python:
- [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275)
